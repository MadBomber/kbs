🧠 AI TRADING STRATEGY
   Market Context: sideways trend, 28.5% volatility
   Strategy: Range‑Targeted Swing Trade
   Rationale: In a sideways market with 28.5% volatility the price tends to oscillate around key support and resistance levels. By deploying a small allocated portion of the portfolio to capture these price swings, we avoid major directional bets while still generating alpha from the existing volatility. The 25% cash reserve provides flexibility for opportunistic entries or stop‑loss adjustments while keeping overall exposure limited.
   Actions: 1️⃣ Allocate 10% of the portfolio to short‑dated (3–6 month) options for a broad market index (e.g., SPY) to lock in implied volatility., 2️⃣ Use 5% of the portfolio to place a long–short “range” trade: buy SPY at support (≈ current 20‑day low) and sell at resistance (≈ current 20‑day high)., 3️⃣ Set tight stop‑losses at 3–4 % below the entry price to protect against sudden breakouts., 4️⃣ Take partial profits (≈ 50–70 %) when the price reaches 70‑80 % of the anticipated price range, then close the position., 5️⃣ Keep the remaining 10% cash in a liquid asset to capture any sudden breakout opportunities, or to re‑enter the strategy if the market starts trending., 6️⃣ Monitor volatility (VIX) and adjust position sizing: tighten stops if volatility spikes, reduce position size if it dips below 28 %.
   Risk Level: MEDIUM
