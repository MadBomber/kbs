üß† AI TRADING STRATEGY
   Market Context: sideways trend, 28.5% volatility
   Strategy: Range‚ÄëCentered Volatility Capture
   Rationale: In a sideways market the price tends to oscillate between support and resistance. With 28.5% implied volatility the option premium is relatively high, making a neutral, time‚Äëdecay‚Äëfocused trade attractive. The strategy utilizes 25‚ÄØ% of the portfolio in cash to preserve liquidity while employing option spreads that profit from staying within the trading range.
   Actions: BUY 1 6‚Äëmonth at‚Äëthe‚Äëmoney (ATM) straddle on the underlying; short 3‚Äëmonth at‚Äëthe‚Äëmoney straddle to form a calendar spread., IF price approaches key resistance (e.g., +1.5% of 26‚Äëweek high), SELL the short leg and LET the long leg expire worthless., IF price approaches key support (e.g., -1.5% of 26‚Äëweek low), CLOSE the positions early to lock in gains or cut losses.

   Key Risks: Extreme volatility (45.2%) amplifies price swings and can quickly widen losses, Strong beta (2.1) exposes the position to amplified moves against the broader market, Consumer‚Äëdiscretionary sector is highly cyclical; economic downturns or negative sentiment can tighten the range further

üí¨ AI EXPLANATION: GOOGL BUY
   Reasoning: 1. The earnings beat demonstrates reliable financial performance and a healthy balance sheet.
2. Strong earnings often reduce investor doubt and can attract new buyers.
3. A positive earnings surprise is a common catalyst for short‚Äëterm price gains, so buying before the next trading session can capture that upside.
